The Hard Truth of Weight-Loss Drugs: You Probably Need Them Forever
4 min read
Dani Blum
Most Americans don’t want to stay on weight-loss drugs long-term, and stop taking them within a year. But research has repeatedly shown that quitting means gaining back the weight.
Dani Blum
Medical authorities like Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., for one, have suggested that the drugs are a temporary bridge, not a long-term tool.
Dani Blum
But weight-loss drugs really are forever drugs. Stop taking them, and you’ll almost always gain back the weight you lost.
Dani Blum
This month, a study showed that the average person who used weight-loss drugs returned to their starting weight around a year and a half after stopping them.
Dani Blum
Doctors are caught in a de facto experiment, trying to modulate between patients’ desires to go off the drugs and the reality that they will probably gain weight when they do.
